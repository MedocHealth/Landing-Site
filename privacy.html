                   <h3>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3> 


                    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures
                    designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
                    safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
                    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
                    guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to
                    defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
                    will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
                    from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
                    environment.


                    We maintain electronic, physical, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection,
                    storage, and disclosure of personal information (including SPDI). Our security procedures may
                    warrant that we occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to
                    you.
                    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets
                    Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information You input in addition to maintaining the
                    security of Your information as per the international standards on "Information Technology Security
                    Techniques Information Security Management System-Requirements".
                    We restrict access to personal information to Our employees and agents who need to know that
                    information to process it for Us and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality
                    obligations and may be disciplined or whose relationship with Us may terminate if they fail to meet
                    these obligations.
                    No employee or administrator will have knowledge of Your password or Your account on the Site or the
                    Application. It is important for You to protect Your account against unauthorised access to Your
                    password and Your mobile phone, as detailed in the ‘User Account, Password and Security’ section of
                    the Terms. You must be sure to log off from the Site when you have finished using it. We do not
                    undertake any liability for any unauthorised use of Your account and password.
                    If you suspect any unauthorised use of your account, you must immediately notify us by sending an
                    email using the contact details indicated in the contact section. You shall be liable to indemnify
                    us for any loss suffered by us due to such unauthorised use of your account or password.


                    You may review, correct, update, or change the information that You have provided by logging into
                    Your account. However, you are not permitted to delete any part of your personal information or any
                    other information generated on the Platform. You may update your information at any point by writing
                    to us using the details indicated below in the contact section.


                    Should You choose to update Your personal information or SPDI or modify it in a way that is not
                    verifiable by Us or leads to such information is incorrect, we will be unable to provide You with
                    access to our Site or the Services, as described under the Terms, and such modification may be
                    regarded as the User seeking to discontinue his or her access to Our Site or the Services.


                    We reserve the right to verify and authenticate your identity and personal information in order to
                    ensure the accurate delivery of products and services. Access to or correction, updating, or
                    deletion of your personal information or SPDI may be denied or limited by Us if it would violate
                    another person’s rights and/or is not otherwise permitted by applicable law.




                    <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>


                    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information,
                    which may be express and/or implied consent, depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
                    withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
                    using the contact details provided in this policy in the Contact Us section.


                    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
                    withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
                    information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.


                    Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and
                    promotional communications that are sent to you through mail at any time by clicking on the
                    unsubscribe link in the emails that we send. You will then be removed from the marketing lists.
                    However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that
                    are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for
                    other non-marketing purposes.


                    <h3>Account Information</h3>


                    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your
                    account, you can:
                    Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
                    Contact us using the contact information provided.
                    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
                    information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to
                    prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms,
                    and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.


                    Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you
                    prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you
                    choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our
                    Services.

                    <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>


                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                    standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
